This project involves automated software testing for the AJIO e-commerce website using Selenium and Python. The test suite includes key functionalities such as logging in, searching for products, and adding items to the cart. The tests are designed to interact with the AJIO website's UI elements, validate their functionality, and handle exceptions gracefully. The test results are captured with screenshots in case of failures, aiding in debugging. The project uses unittest for structuring the test cases and concurrent.futures for running tests concurrently to improve efficiency. To execute the tests, clone the repository, ensure you have the required dependencies installed (e.g., Selenium and a compatible WebDriver), and run the test suite. Contributions to enhance test coverage or add new features are welcome through forks and pull requests.
